Netbeans Dark Theme
=================

My Personal Netbeans Dark Theme

This theme took me a while to build, it's an evolution of about 2.5 yrs of using netbeans.

I think it's good enough to look at all day long without getting eye strain.

Netbeans doesn't provide really any good themes so I made my own.
