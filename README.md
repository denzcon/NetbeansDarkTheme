Netbeans Dark Theme
=================

My Personal Netbeans Dark Theme

This theme took me a while to build, it's an evolution of about 2.5 yrs of using netbeans.

I think it's good enough to look at all day long without getting eye strain.

Netbeans doesn't provide really any good themes so I made my own.

using font: Source Code Pro 12 from [github](https://github.com/adobe/Source-Code-Pro)

To use this theme, open up your netbeans:

- click upper menu
  - tools->options

- Look at the bottom of dialog window for button: import
- Browse for the darktheme.zip file
- select: All
- Then select okay
- that's all it takes.
